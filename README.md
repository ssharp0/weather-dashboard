Weather Dashboard (OpenWeather API)

This application uses the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to retrieve weather data for searched cities, and utilizes local storage for a search history. This application is powered by html, css and javascript. 

The user will be able to search the weather outlook for multiple cities using the search input. 

The user will be presented with current and future conditions for the searched city, and the searched city will be added to the search history for the user to view. 

The user will see the city name, the date, a weather icon, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index for the city's current weather. 

The UV Index will change background color depending on the UV index:
- favorable (green)
- moderate (orange)
- severe (red)

When the user views the five day forecast - each forecast day will show the date, forecasted weather icon, the forecasted temperature, and the forcasted humidity

When the user clicks on a city in the search history then they will be shown the current and forecasted weather conditions for that city. 

When the user opens the weather dashboard/refreshes, it will show the current and forecasted weather conditions for the last searched date (from local storage).

The user can also clear the search history and the local storage.
